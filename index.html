        I am a Vietnamese-American student attending San Jose State University, studying Computer Science.
        A significant teacher in high school along with my passion for learning and problem solving led me into this major. <br> 
        <br>
        I also love spending time with family, friends, and my girlfriend. I also used to play a lot of video games, but not much anymore!
