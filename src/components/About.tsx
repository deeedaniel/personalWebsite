          Hi there! I’m Daniel Nguyen, a passionate and driven second-year
          Computer Science student with a love for building innovative digital
          experiences. From coding up engaging apps to diving into the world of
          AI, I’m constantly exploring new ways to use technology to solve
          real-world problems. I’ve got experience with a wide range of
          tools—React, TypeScript, MongoDB, Firebase, and more—that help bring
          my ideas to life. Whether it's a social media platform with a unique
          twist or an AI-powered wellness agent, I’m always excited to take on
          new challenges and collaborate with others to create something
          impactful.
          <br />
          <br />
          Outside of coding, I’m a hackathon enthusiast and a firm believer in
          the power of teamwork and creativity. When I’m not building the next
          big thing, you can find me experimenting with new tech or
          brainstorming my next project. Feel free to browse my work, and don’t
          hesitate to reach out—I’d love to connect!
